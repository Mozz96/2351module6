        <h1>Module 6</h1><br>
        <h2>This lesson is going over arrays, objects, and methods!</h2><br>
        <h3>The first line on the console is an array, listing a few of my favorite foods I want to have this week! (notice how many cheese-related foods there are? I just think that's funny)</h3>
        <h3>The second line in the console is an object, listing out a description of a cherry pie! (very into food this assignment, I'm very hungry today!)</h3>
        <h3>The third line is an example of an array method: I want to add a list of favorite drinks to enjoy with my meals, so I created a favorite drinks array then added them to the existing array using the concat() method!</h3>
        <h3>The fourth and final line is an example of an object method: here, I put together the object to describe my favorite pie, using the this keyword to call on each property, then call the method to the console!</h3>
